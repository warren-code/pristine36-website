# Accessibility Improvements Needed

## Issues Found:
1. ✅ Missing aria-labels on interactive elements (Fixed in Header)
2. ❌ No skip navigation link
3. ❌ Missing lang attribute on HTML (Actually present)
4. ❌ Images without alt text (Logo SVGs)
5. ❌ Form validation messages not announced
6. ❌ Focus indicators need improvement
7. ❌ Color contrast ratios need verification
8. ❌ Mobile touch targets too small (minimum 44x44px)

## Fixes Applied:
- Added aria-label to logo link
- Added aria-expanded to mobile menu button
- Added aria-hidden to decorative icons
- Form already has proper labels and required attributes

## Still Needed:
- Skip navigation link
- Focus visible styles enhancement
- Touch target size verification
- Color contrast audit
- Screen reader announcements for form errors
